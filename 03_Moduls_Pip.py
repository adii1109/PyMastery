#  Module is like a code can be used to borrow the code written by
#somebody else in our python program. there are two two types of modules in 
#python


#1.Bulit in Modules : -
#These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the 
#python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly


#2.External Modules :
#These modules are imported from a third party file or  can be installed using a 
#package manger like pip or conda. Since this code is written by 
#someone else, we can install different versions of a same modules 
#with time
